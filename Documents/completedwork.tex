The deliverables of this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A kernel header file for LLD to consume and use as a plugin to interact with LLD tester
\item A LLD tester kernel module code which will have CUTest ported to Linux kernel as unit test framework and in addition will have kernel module with generic test cases common for any LLD.
\item A user level application to configure the test cases, initiate test run and collect the test execution reports
\item A user guide to how to use the generic test cases and extend the LLD tester for a specific functionality of LLD.
\item Evaluation reports of the execution of generic test cases using LLD tester against two or more LLD, mutation information and efficiency of test cases by number of mutant identified by the test cases. 

\end{enumerate}
